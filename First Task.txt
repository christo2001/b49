Difference  http and https ?

HTTP:
   An HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. The HTTP protocol provides communication between different communication systems. 
   When the user makes an HTTP request on the browser, then the webserver sends the requested data to the user in the form of web pages.
   An HTTP is a stateless protocol as each transaction is executed separately without having any knowledge of the previous transactions,
   which means that once the transaction is completed between the web browser and the server, the connection gets lost.

HTTPS:
   The full form of HTTPS is Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. The HTTP protocol does not provide the security of the data,
   while HTTP ensures the security of the data. Therefore, we can say that HTTPS is a secure version of the HTTP protocol.
   This protocol allows transferring the data in an encrypted form. The use of HTTPS protocol is mainly required where we need to
   enter the bank account details.
